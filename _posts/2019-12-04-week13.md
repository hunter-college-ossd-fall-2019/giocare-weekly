#### Open Source For Companies
<!-- The second article is intended to convince CIO's about the importance of open source for companies. What are your reactions to this article? -->

#### Personal
<!-- Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software? Why or why not? What would your dream job be? How would you like to see the business of software production in ten years?  -->

I'd like to work at a company that values giving back to their community and bringing up the next generation of technologists.
Funfact: Bloomberg employees would use their hours to mentor my highschool robotics team

#### Gatsby Update - Blog Site
Good News!! We were able to complete the blog site within our outlined timeline and Toby created a [pull request]. There was an issue with one of the files necessary to complete the contribute, but one of the gatsby maintainers was nice enough to make a pull request in our repo with the correct changes. And thus, the pull request was approved and merged! One contribution down, one more to go!! Our site [Amelie] is up and running.


#### Gatsby Update - Portfolio Site
Our next contribution is the portfolio site for developers. Since this site is targeted towards a specific audience, I thought it would interesting to have the portfolio site resemble two critical tools that developers use daily, the terminal and text editor. The index page has been designed to look like a terminal and is complete with a typing animation. The rest of the pages of the site have been designed to resemble a text editor. I've shared the design with fellow developers and have been met with positive remarks on the idea as well as the design.

We are almost done with the site and should be ready to make a pull request by Thursday.

Goals For This Week :

[ ✔️ ] Create and Style Terminal <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Create Nav Bar <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Create Projects Page <br/>
[ ⚠️ ] Finish About Page <br/>
[ ⚠️ ] Fix Responsiveness of Site <br/>
[ ❌ ] Write Documentation For Theme <br/>
[ ❌ ] Deploy To Netlify <br/>

Here is a preview of the site:
