title: Week 13 - The Future Of Open Source?
---

This week, I'll discuss the future of open source, the impact open source is having in humanitarian projects, my goals for the future and give an update on my Gatsby project.

Tom Callaway's [Musings on Open Source Software Business Models] discusses different open source business models, their issues and thoughts for the future.

**Initial Thoughts:**  
When Callaway first lists the business models, the open core model was the one that immediately caught my attention. In week 3, we read [10 Things You Should Know About Open Source Before You Use It], and myth #8 stated that "most open source is as reliable as its proprietary counterpart". Open core is a perfect solution to that. An Open Core product allows users bask in the satisfaction that the code is open source but also alleviates their worries by using reliable, well known proprietary software. In my opinion, these seem like a win-win scenario! 

**After Finishing The Article:**  
By the end of the article, my attitude and feelings towards open core had dramatically changed. When Callaway says "After all, if your customers are locked in, it is easy to reach a point where you have no real business case for improving the software, either via new features, improved usability, or bug fixing." that's when it hit me. I often find myself frustrated with the proprietary software I use daily and constantly checking when updates will be released, in hopes that it'll fix the bugs. But I keep using the software because it's essential and I am dependant on it.

Not only is his statement true, but it also speaks for the necessity of open source. If the only products available are proprietary, those creators have no obligation to improve products since there is a lack of competition.



#### Open Source For Companies
<!-- The second article is intended to convince CIO's about the importance of open source for companies. What are your reactions to this article? -->

Of the advantages mentioned, speed is a great reason to turn to open source, as it allows projects to grow at a much faster rate due to the sheer volume of people continuously contributing, finding issues and making fixes. Creating an open-source project enables the user to have many eyes working on the project, other communities to turn to for help and this, in turn, results in speed, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, maintenance costs and the ability to attract better talent.


#### Personal Questions
<!-- Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software? 
Why or why not? What would your dream job be? How would you like to see the business of software production in ten years?  -->
1. *Would you want to work in a company that only produced open-source software? Why or why not?*  
    For me, the mission and morals of a company are important to me. I would love to work in a company that only produced open-source software because that means they are constantly growing, working directly with users to deliver high-quality content and actively involved with the community.

2. *What would your dream job be?*  
    My dream job is to create my own company. I don't have a traditional job as my dream job due to my vast interest in different fields. Instead of sticking to one thing, I want to have the opportunity to explore and combine career paths.
    
    Teaching is an important part of who I am, and I've spent the last 4 years teaching computer science, 3D printing and hardware abroad and in public schools throughout New York. I'd like to some day work at a place that values giving back to the community and bringing up the next generation of technologists.  
    Question: Are there any companies or organizations that are dedicated to bringing open source into classrooms?
    
3. *How would you like to see the business of software production in ten years?*  
    Truthfully, the future of technology scares and amazes me. With the introduction of Artificial Intelligence into our everyday lives, I fear that we are further being pushed into the corner and surrounded by proprietary software. Ultimately, I would love to see more businesses become makers instead of takers and push towards fully open source companies. Also, I'm interested in seeing more diversity in open source and maybe being apart of that change.


#### Humanitarian Projects
<!-- Read this article: https://opensource.com/tags/humanitarian, and browse the projects listed there. Pick one that interests you and write about it in your blog post for Week 13. -->

This week we discussed how open source is being used in countless humanitarian projects. I chose to focus on the article [How a university's 3D-printed prosthetics club provides devices for amputees] because it's an area I have some experience in.

A few years ago, I prototyped a prosthetic robotic hand to be used in a biomedical engineering course for a girl's coding camp in Ghana. Just like the article, I used an open-source model as a basis for 3D printing. Then I used flex sensors to modify a glove, which would be used to control the robotic hand. While my project had little impact, it's inspiring to know that the same tools are being used to transform lives every day. 


#### Gatsby Update - Blog Site
Good News!! We were able to complete the blog site within our outlined timeline and Toby created a [pull request]. There was an issue with one of the files necessary to complete the contribute, but one of the Gatsby maintainers was nice enough to make a pull request in our repo with the correct changes. And thus, the pull request was approved and merged! One contribution down, one more to go!! Our site [Amelie] is up and running.


#### Gatsby Update - Portfolio Site
Our next contribution is the portfolio site for developers. Since this site is targeted towards a specific audience, I thought it would interesting to have the portfolio site resemble two critical tools that developers use daily, the terminal and text editor. The index page has been designed to look like a terminal and is complete with a typing animation. The rest of the site has been designed to resemble a text editor, and a user can select files to navigate through the site. I've shared the design with fellow developers and have been met with positive remarks on the idea as well as the design.

The site is almost complete and a pull request will be made by the end of the week.

Goals For This Week :

[ ✔️ ] Create and Style Terminal <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Create Nav Bar <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Create Projects Page <br/>
[ ⚠️ ] Finish About Page <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Fix Responsiveness of Site <br/>
[ ❌ ] Write Documentation For Theme <br/>
[ ❌ ] Deploy To Netlify <br/>
[ ❌ ] Contribute Theme To Gatsby <br/>

Here is a preview of the site:
