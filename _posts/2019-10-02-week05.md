title: Week 5 - GitHub WorkFlow?

### Finding A Project
<!--The article on finding a project to which you can contribute has a great amount of information and advice. It also has links to other webpages that help you in finding projects. Explore these links and comment on which might prove to be useful, and whether they have helped you to narrow down your search. -->
GitHub's [How To Contribute] details how to go about your first contribution, provides resources to discover projects and includes a checklist to help identify beginner friendly projects. I found the checklist to be extremely helpful as I searched for projects I'd be interested in contributing to. In the process, I came across projects with open issues but the last commit was months ago, projects without a contributing document as well as projects that looked like they were open source - but they werent.

In my search, I came across the following projects/sites :
1. [Contribute To Open Source] - I found this repo using GitHub Explore and this is a great resource for anyone interested in contributing code
2. [Swag For Dev] - One of the best projects I've seen!! I would love to contribute by either adding an opportunity for developers to earn free swag (because who doesn't like free stuff?) or suggesting ways to improve the UI of the site.
3. [Neufund] - While browsing the site, I noticed that the choice of color and font on certain pages made the text unreadable. I'd be interested in creating an issue for that and assisting in the front end development.
4. [First Contributions] - For anyone looking to contribute to an open source project, they alreasy use, this is a good starting point.

#### Using Git In And Out Of Class
<!-- Make some comments about all of this git and GitHub stuff you learned about this week. Hard? Easy? Confusing? Useful? -->
In class this week, we were grouped into teams of three to complete a [Git Workflow Activity]. This activity allowed us to experience how an open source project functions. Throughout this activity, we nominated one of the team members as the "maintainer", created a repository, forked and cloned the repo to make contributions and created issues.

This past weekend, I attended HackNY with a [classmate] where we used git to contribute to our project, [Fashion Forward]. After all the exercises we've been doing in class as well as the quiz we took, contributing to our project was an abolute breeze. Aside from the occasional merge conflicts, I'm proud to say I had no issues with git.


#### A Glance At My Week
1. Participated in an inclass [Git Workflow Activity]
2. Used the [Collaboration Workflow Presentation] as a refrence at a Hackathon
3. Read GitHub's [How To Contribute] and began looking for projects to contribut to
4. Continued contibuting to [Open Street Map]
