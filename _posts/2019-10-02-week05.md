#### In Class Git Activity 
Having previous git experience, I went into the Git activity thinking that it would be a easy but sadly that was not the case. In my group, I was the first person to make push any chances, so I didn't encounter any changes. But as time went on, everytime I tried to push a change, I was met with the following error :

*hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g. git pull ...') before pushing again. See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.*

I was able to resolve these conflicts by pulling from master, merging the changes, then pushing my changes. Overall, this wass a great opportunity to relearn git basics and work with my fellow classmates.
