title: Week 8 - My Project Plan?
---


#### Project Selection
<!-- Chronicle your activities related to the project on which you are going to work. What did you do to install the development environment? What issues are you considering? How are you filtering them? What are you reading? In general, write about the work you are doing on your project. -->
After last week's [project evaluation], I decided to pick [Gatsby] as the project I'll be contributing to for the remainder of the semester. Aside from having a friendly community, this is a tool that I see myself using in the near future and I would love to have a hand in making it better. Looking at the issues, a few of the beginner ones were related to documentation and the creation of articles for the website. This is a great starting point to get my feet wet and learn more about Gatsby in the process.

Ultimately, I am interested in contributing to the [starter library], which is a collection of boilerplate Gatsby sites maintained by the community and intended for jump-starting development quickly. While browsing the starter library, I noticed that most of the starter libraries were functional but the aesthetic vision was missing and overall it wasn't user friendly. 

Creating a starter theme gives me the opportunity to combine my UI, UX and programming skills while creating a meaningful product that will be used by Gatsby consumers. And since Gatsby already has section in their [contributing guide] which outlines how to contribute to the starter library, all that's left is for me to get started.

#### Starter Theme Plan
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Download Gatsby
- [‚ö†Ô∏è] Read Documentation And Get Familiar With Gatsby
- [üí°] Decide On What Type Of Theme I'd Like To Make

- [‚ùå] Contribute Theme To Gatsby
