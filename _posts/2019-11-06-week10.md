#### Makers And Takers
<!-- 
The article by Dries Buytaert (https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source) raised many interesting and controversial ideas. In your blog for Week 10, include a section entitled Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert in which you discuss the things about this article that you agree with and the things that bother you. Articulate your reasons for each.

#### Wikipedia Investigation
<!--
Write about what you find, or what you discovered and what was hard while investigating Wikipedia's pages.
-->
I decided to learn about Wikipedia through [The Wikipedia Adventure], which is an interactive tutorial meant to teach new contributors editing, cooperation and collaboration skills. Along the way, I learned how to do the following:
- Create A User Page
- Format Text
- Reply To Messages In Talk Pages
- Compare Two Versions Of A Page
- Check For Bias And Verifiability
- Ask A Question In The Teahouse, a place for new editors to ask questions and meet other members in the community.
- Insert A Table of Contents
- Add A Citation
- Add Images From Wikipedia Commons

After [completing the adventure], I was prompted with a list of resources. Among the resources I noticed that Wikipedia has an [Open Task] page, which contains a list of articles that need quick fixes. After selecting an article from the list, I corrected eight spelling and grammar mistakes and [published my changes]! In addition, I encountered an issue while completing the adventure and I plan on mentioning it in the talk page.


#### Gatsby
<!--    
Update your progress on the issues you have isolated in your project. Be detailed and be specific. Provide links to issues, to Pull Requests, to the project. If relevant, provide links to your forked copy of the project if it is in the class organization, or even in your own GitHub account, if that fork has commits or files that pertain to what you are writing. Give a timeline of your progress.

Before I share my progress for this week, I'd like to share the detailed timeline I created for myself. I decided to make this timeline just so I have a visual representation of how much work I have to do as well as how I can best manage to get this completed. This exercise proved to be extremely useful. When I began to write down everything I needed to do, things that I overlooked or didn't take into account popped up. For example, in my original plan I wrote down "Contribute to Gatsby", but I didn't take into account writing documentation for the theme and deploying to Netlify which are necessary before I can make my pull request. Moving forward, I will still use the starter theme plan from the previous weeks but I thought it would be a good idea to share my thought process as well as what to expect in the coming weeks.

This week I spent time reading the [Laws Of UX], [7 UX Principles for Creating a Great Website] and [UX Design Principles for Newcomers] in an effort to familiarize myself with core UX principles. Reading these articles gave me some insight into the best ways to make a user friendly website and also I learned some design mistakes I've been making.
