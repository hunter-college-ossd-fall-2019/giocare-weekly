title: Week 10 - The Wikipedia Adventure Begins?
---

This week, I'll discuss some of my takeaways from Dries Buytaert's [Makers and Takers], share how my Wikipedia exploration went and give an update on my Gatsby project.

<!-- 
The article by Dries Buytaert (https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source) raised many interesting and controversial ideas. In your blog for Week 10, include a section entitled Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert in which you discuss the things about this article that you agree with and the things that bother you. Articulate your reasons for each.
-->
#### ðŸ¤” Idea #1 : The Future Of Tech Companies
At one point in the article, Dries Buytaert boldly states that he'd "like to see every technology company become an Open Source company. Today, Open Source companies are still extremely rare." I do agree that many software are black-boxed and as consumers, we're often left in the dark wondering how it works. But companies have the right to protect their work. Exposing their software has the potential to not only hurt business but invalidates the hard work of developers. In the case where a product violates the law, I believe the code must be revealed.

#### ðŸ¤” Idea #2 : New Licenses
Buytaert suggests that open source projects experiment with new licenses as a means of scaling and sustaining. He then cites MariaDb's Business Source License (BSL), which gives users complete access to the source code. But when they use more than x of the software they have to pay for a license. While I think this is a great idea, I have some concerns. 
1. How does an open-source project monitor who is using their product and how much?
2. What happens when a company finds a loophole in the license?
3. How do you force a company to pay for a licens?

#### Wikipedia Investigation
<!--
Write about what you find, or what you discovered and what was hard while investigating Wikipedia's pages.

I decided to learn about Wikipedia through [The Wikipedia Adventure], which is an interactive tutorial meant to teach new contributors editing, cooperation, and collaboration skills. Along the way, I learned how to do the following:
- Create A User Page
- Format Text
- Reply To Messages In Talk Pages
- Compare Two Versions Of A Page
- Check For Bias And Verifiability
- Ask A Question In The Teahouse, a place for new editors to ask questions and meet other members in the community.
- Insert A Table of Contents
- Add A Citation
- Add Images From Wikipedia Commons

After [completing the adventure], I was prompted with a list of resources. Among the resources, I noticed that Wikipedia has an [Open Task] page, which contains a list of articles that need quick fixes. After selecting an article from the list, I corrected eight spelling and grammar mistakes and [published my changes]! Also, I encountered an issue while completing the adventure and I plan on mentioning it on the talk page.

#### Gatsby
<!--    
Update your progress on the issues you have isolated in your project. Be detailed and be specific. Provide links to issues, to Pull Requests, to the project. If relevant, provide links to your forked copy of the project if it is in the class organization, or even in your own GitHub account, if that fork has commits or files that pertain to what you are writing. Give a timeline of your progress.
-->

Before I give my progress for this week, I'd like to share the detailed timeline I created for myself. I decided to make this timeline to have a visual representation of the amount of work needed to complete this project. I found this exercise proved to be extremely useful. When I began writing, tasks that I overlooked or didn't take into account popped up. For example, in my original plan I wrote down "Contribute to Gatsby", but I didn't take into account writing documentation for the theme and deploying to Netlify which are necessary before I can make my pull request. Moving forward, I will still use the starter theme plan from the previous weeks but I thought it would be a good idea to share my thought process as well as what to expect in the coming weeks.

This week I spent time reading the [Laws Of UX], [7 UX Principles for Creating a Great Website] and [UX Design Principles for Newcomers] to familiarize myself with core UX principles. Reading these articles gave me some insight into the best ways to make a user-friendly website and also I learned some design mistakes I've been making.

#### A Glance At My Week
1. Read [Makers and Takers]
2. Read [Contributing to Wikipedia] and [A Primer for Newcomers].
3. Explored Wikipedia [Talk Pages]
4. Followed Along With [Unix] Tutorial and [Open Encyclopedias Presentation]
5. Made A Wikipedia Contribution
