title: Week 7 - 
---

For this weeks blog, Iâ€™ll discuss the project evaluation process, what I learned and give an update on some ways I contributed outside of class.

For this week, your goal is to describe the project evaluation that you did. What was hard? what did you learn? Are you interested in the particular project that you evaluated now? What was the hardest task? Do not limit yourself to these questions.

#### Gatsby
The goal of this weeks class was to take a project and evaluate it in teams using this [template]. The project we chose, [Gatsby], is an open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. Our approach in completing this activity was to split up the sections and I was responsible for finding information relating to their license, documentation and welcomeness. When I was looking for projects [last week], I focused on the technical aspects such as the languages being used and the types of issues being opened. This activity was a great way for me to look at open source projects through the community lens. While doing this activity, I learned that Gatsby is an active community where issues and pull requests are being made every day. Looking through the issues, I noticed that every question was answered in a timely manner and maintainers would provide suggestions on how to address the problem. On Gatsby's website, they have a comprehensive contributing guide which gives guidance on all types of contributions. In addition, they created an issue to encourage first-timers to contribute for HacktoberFest and included a list of sample contributions.

Looking at the pull requests, I noticed that after a pull request has been approved, the maintainers thank the contributors, offer to send them Gatsby sway and invite them to join the team of maintainers. I have yet to see another project with such a welcoming and friendly community. Gatsby is a tool that I will use in my everyday life and I am strongly considering it as a project for my first contribution.
