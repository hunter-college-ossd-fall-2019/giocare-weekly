#### Gatsby Update
The first site Toby and I will be contributing is a blog site. This week, we were able to make a tremendous amount of progress. I began the week by sketching out a design for theme, then used Figma to prototype it. As of now, the index page is complete.

Goals For This Week :

[ ✔️ ] Create and Style Blog Cards <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Create Nav Bar <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Create Featured Blog <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Finish Index Page <br/>
[ ⚠️ ] Create Blog Template <br/>
[ ⚠️ ] Finish About Page <br/>
[ ❌ ] Write Documentation For Theme <br/>
[ ❌ ] Deploy To Netlify <br/>
[ ❌ ] Contribute Theme To Gatsby <br/>

Here are pictures of the mockups and a preview of the site.
