title: Week 12 - Let's Talk About Voting Fraud?

#### Voting Fraud
As a voting American, I constantly find myself dreading election days due to the long lines and outdated technology. Trust The Vote's solution to creating an open voting platform looks to address the issues of aging machines and vulnerable system designs. But as usual, I'm a skeptic.

Initially, I was worried that having an open-source voting platform would lead to even more issues of voter fraud. But the author alleviated my fears by stating that the code commit process is managed closely and the thoughts of federal governments are being taken into account. I'm interested in learning if contributors have to go through a background check to ensure that they're skilled enough to aid in this process. I would assume that such an important project with real-life consequences shouldn't be seen by just anyone.

I'll continue to be skeptical about introducing open-source to the voting system, but I'm willing to give it a chance.

#### Gatsby Update
The first contribution Toby and I will be making is a blog theme. We were able to make a tremendous amount of progress this week!! On Monday, I sketched a design for the theme, then used Figma to prototype it. For the index page, we set up blog cards, a featured post, created a navbar and styled everything. As of now, the index page is complete and we are well on our way to contributing the theme by the end of the week.

Goals For This Week :

[ ✔️ ] Create and Style Blog Cards <br/>
[ ✔️ ] Create Nav Bar <br/>

Here are pictures of the mockups and a preview of the site.
