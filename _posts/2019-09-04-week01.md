### Why Open Source?

Honestly, I decided to take a course in Open Source Software because a friend of mine suggested it. During the spring semester, my friend would constantly mention how this was one of the most useful classes she had taken at Hunter and when registration came around, she encouraged me to take it. In addition, I am interested in learning the origins of open source, mastering the git workflow, and most importantly, making an impact on a project.


After doing some research, i'm still not entirely sure what open source is, as everyone has slightly varying definitions. But it did bring up some questions which I hope will be answered over the course of the semester.
- What happens to a project when the developer dies?
- What resources exist to prevent developers from burning out?
- What laws are in place to prevent contributors from being exploited?
