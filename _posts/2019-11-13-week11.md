<!-- Write about the visit by Kevin Fleming. What did you learn? Contrast what he had to say about Bloomberg LP's involvement with what Bill Reyner described about FactSet's involvement. -->
#### Kevin Fleming
This week, Kevin Fleming, a member of the CTO Office at Bloomberg, visited the class to share how Bloomberg is involved in open-source projects. Of the topics Fleming mentioned, here are the two that stood out to me:

- Bloomberg is heavily involved in Jupyter, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. One of Bloomberg's contributions involved making the Jupyter Notebook user friendly and this was conducted through the Project Jupyter UX Design session. I was fascinated to hear about the exercises conducted, learn discoveries made and see the final product. Fleming mentioned an card exercise, which allows users to explicitly show what tasks in the menu are vital so that they wont be buried so far in the menu bar. This is the kind of contribution I'd like to make in the future! In addition, while doing research, I discovered that two Bloomberg employees are members of Jupyter's [Steering Council], which is a collective created to ensure the long-term well-being of the project, both technically and as a community. That's awesome!

- Bloomberg regularly hosts Open Source Day/Weekend events with the purpose of encouraging employees, community members and students to contribute to open source projects.

In relation to the [Makers and Takers] article I discussed last week, I would classify Bloomberg and FactSet as Takers, but on different levels. FactSet actively encourages their employees to spend time contribution to projects and makes their clients aware of the open source software being use. Bloomberg on the other hand, does this to a much higher degree. They are not only using open-source software, they are investing back into it through the use of community events. This in turn helps open-source projects become sustainable.


Overall, after hearing Bill Reyner and Kevin Fleming talk about how important open-source software is to their companies, I will make a more conscious effort to use products from companies that are giving back to the community.
