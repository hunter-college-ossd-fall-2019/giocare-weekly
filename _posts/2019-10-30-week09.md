#### The Cathedral and the Bazaar
<!-- Summarize your impressions about the Eric Raymond's The Cathedral and the Bazaar. In particular, what are the three concepts from that book that most impressed you? -->
For this weeks blog, I'll discuss some of the myths and misconceptions surrounding the world of open source, as mentioned in this Eric Raymond's [The Cathedral and the Bazaar] and give an update on my Gatsby project.

#### üïµÔ∏è Concept #1 : The Cathedral vs The Bazaar

cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta to be released before its time.

#### üïµÔ∏è Concept #2 : The Importance of Having Users
Users are an underrated and essential component to having a successful open source project. At the beginning of the semester, it was mentioned that majority of the people who use open source softwares had limited programming experiences but were still able to contribute in meaningful ways. Reading the article, it was great to see Raymond reiterate this concept by mentioning that creating a loyal base encourages them to send bug issues and suggest fixes.

Interestingly enough, last week I noticed a bug in an app that I regularly use. So I immediately sent an email to the developer, detailing the issue and steps he would need to take to replicate the issue. Prior to this class, this is something I wouldn't have thought about doing.

#### üïµÔ∏è Concept #3 : 


#### Starter Theme Plan
[ ‚úîÔ∏è ] Download Gatsby <br/>
