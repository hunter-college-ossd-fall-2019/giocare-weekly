title: Week 6 - Inspiring Guest Speaker?
---


#### Karen Sandler
This week, [Karen Sandler], the executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC), visited the class to talk about software licenses and software freedom.

It was fascinating to hear that her interest in open source began as a result of a personal struggle. And instead of looking at it negatively
she used this as an opportunity to change the lives of others. 

Prior to Sandler's talk, I was curious to know if a contributor had any say when it came to how their code was used and whether or not it could be sold without their permission. And they do! In fact, Sandler mentioned that as developers we have so much power - and that one line resonates with me.

When I think about my career longterm, I don't see myself sitting behind a computer coding. I've always been interested in the regulation of technology as well as the impact technology has on society. As a result, I plan to get my masters in Human Computer Interaction. 

After the talk I felt even more motivated to achieve this goal.
