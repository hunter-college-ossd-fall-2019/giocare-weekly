title: Week 6 - Inspiring Guest Speaker?
---


#### Karen Sandler
This week, [Karen Sandler], the executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC), visited the class to talk about software licenses and software freedom.

It was fascinating to hear that the world of open source isn't so black and white, there are so many gray areas to the point where lawyers are not in agreement on how to proceed in certain cases.
Prior to Sandler's talk, I was curious to know if a contributor had any say when it came to how their code was used and whether or not it could be sold without their permission. And they do! One takeways "as developers, you have so much power".


When I think about my career longterm, I don't see myself sitting behind a computer coding. I've always been interested in the regulation of techbology as well as the impact technology has on society. As a result, I plan to get my masters in Human Computer Interaction. After Sandler's talk I felt motivated to achieve this goal.
