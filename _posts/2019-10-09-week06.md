title: Week 6 - Inspiring Guest Speaker?
---


#### Karen Sandler
This week, [Karen Sandler], the executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC), visited the class to talk about software licenses and software freedom.

It was fascinating to hear that her interest in open source began as a result of a personal struggle. And instead of looking at it negatively
she used this as an opportunity to change the lives of others. 

Prior to Sandler's talk, I was curious to know if a contributor had any say when it came to how their code was used and whether or not it could be sold without their permission. And they do! In fact, Sandler mentioned that as developers we have so much power - and that one line resonates with me.

When I think about my career longterm, I don't see myself sitting behind a computer coding. I've always been interested in the regulation of technology as well as the impact technology has on society. As a result, I plan to get my masters in Human Computer Interaction. 

After the talk I felt even more motivated to achieve this goal.



#### The Search For Projects Begin
<!-- I will provide suggestions for where and how to look. In this week's blog, write about which projects you looked at, why you rejected them, which are still possible, and which look good to you. Treat your blog like a diary this week. -->
The goal of this week was to begin thinking about the types of projects we'd like to contibute to, search for those projects and critique them using the [Project Evaluation Guide]. In addition to the projects I found [last week], here are a few more that I'd be interested in contributing to.

1. Project #1 - [Dev Snippets]
- Dev Snippets is a collection of useful code snippets for new developers.
- This is a great opportunity to help new developers and test my knowledge in different languages. In addition, while browsing the site, I noticed that some essential git commands were missing.
- Verdict : ‚úîÔ∏è

2. Project #2 - [Flutter Calendar Carousel]
- Calendar widget for flutter that is swipeable horizontally.
- After coming across a list of [Open-Source iOS Apps] this weekend, I started learning Flutter and Dart. For this project, I'd be interested in redesigning the UI and finding bugs. But I did not see a contributing guide, so I'm a little hesistant to pick this project.
- Verdict : ‚ö†Ô∏è


3. Project #3 - [Popular Movie Quotes]
- A simple NPM package to get popular movie quotes.
- This project is currently looking for movie quotes to be added to the json file. This is a simple and easy way to contribute.
- Verdict : ‚úîÔ∏è

4. Project #4 - [Inspirational Quotes]
- A simple NPM Package which returns random Inspirational Quotes.
- Similar to the previous one, this project is currently looking for inspirational quotes to be added to the json file.
- Verdict : ‚úîÔ∏è

5. Project #5 - [Tabler]
- Premium and Open Source dashboard template with responsive and high-quality UI.
- In the documentation, I noticed that the contribute link is broken.
- Verdict : ‚úîÔ∏è

6. Project #6 - [Aroo]
- This is a membership application app written by members of Double Union, a feminist hacker/makerspace for women in San Francisco.
- Ideally, this would be a project that interests me. But, this application isn't written in a language that I'm familiar with and I don't have any knowledge on Double Union.
- Verdict : üõë
